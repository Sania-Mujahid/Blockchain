                                            If Pakistan uses this energy for bitcoin mining
                                            using the latest S19 Pro Antminer …it can
                                            generate $35 billion worth of Bitcoin per year at
                                            current valuations.

                                                  ….this means we can pay off our
                                                  external debt in two years.

…Pakistan may already have 50 per cent more capacity than demand.

And even though Pakistan is unable to use the excess it is producing, adding further insult to injury, the
government has to pay for the energy even if it is not being used.                                         5

“This is a very precious opportunity for you to be able to sit in this class,” Dawn
Song, a computer science professor, told the students. “There are a bazillion other
students who are waiting for your spot.”

“The students in my class are from every possible discipline,” said Campbell
Harvey, a professor at Duke’s business school, who is teaching a class with 231
students this semester. “They understand that this is going to disrupt many
different areas of business, and they want to be the disrupters, not the disruptees.”   8
